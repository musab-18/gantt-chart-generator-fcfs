# ðŸ•’ Gantt Chart Generator using FCFS Scheduling

This project simulates the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** scheduling algorithm in Operating Systems and generates a visual **Gantt Chart** to represent process execution over time.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

**First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** is one of the simplest scheduling algorithms in Operating Systems where the process that arrives first gets executed first. This project helps users understand how FCFS works by:

- Taking process inputs with Arrival Time and Burst Time.
- Calculating essential metrics like Completion Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time.
- Displaying a tabular summary.
- Generating a graphical **Gantt Chart** to visualize the process schedule.
